# Single-Agent Attention Actor-Critic (SA3C): A Novel Solution for Low-Thrust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization
We provide the code repository for our paper. This repository includes the necessary code to replicate our experiments and utilize our SA3C-DRL model for spacecraft trajectory planning. By accessing the repository, researchers and practitioners can benefit from our approach to efficiently transfer spacecraft to GEO and CisLunar Transfer Points (NRHO and Patch-Point).
